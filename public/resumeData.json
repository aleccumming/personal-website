    "bio":"I am a fifth-year computer science student and former UBC baseball player. I was born and grew up in West Vancouver and have been interested in computers and technology from a young age. One of my defining characteristics is that I have a bit of an addictive personality, meaning I tend to become deeply passionate about what Iâ€™m doing, whether it be hobbies, or studying or sports. Outside of school and work, I love playing sports and I enjoy the outdoors. However, when the weather turns and I have to spend my time indoors, I love puzzles, playing games, and spending time with my friends and family.",
